-- Fix for duplicate "Pipeline Principal" rows per tenant.
--
-- Root cause: ensureDefaultPipeline checked pipeline_stages for existence but
-- created rows in pipelines — two concurrent GET /pipelines requests could both
-- see "no stages" and each create a full default pipeline + stage set.
--
-- This migration:
--   1. Collapses any existing duplicate default pipelines per tenant: picks the
--      oldest as canonical, remaps deals from extra-pipeline stages to the
--      canonical stage with the same name (or the canonical's first stage as
--      fallback), then deletes the extras (cascade removes their stages).
--   2. Adds a partial unique index so two default pipelines can never coexist
--      again — the INSERT in ensureDefaultPipeline uses ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING
--      to safely absorb races.
--
-- Idempotent: the DO block is a no-op when no duplicates exist; IF NOT EXISTS
-- guards the index. Safe on both empty and already-migrated databases.
